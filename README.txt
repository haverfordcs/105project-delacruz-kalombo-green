To run this code all that needs to be done is to run it on PyCharm. The two player hangman game will commence and the first word giving player gives the word that will be hidden to the second player. Only one letter can be guessed at a time and the phrase cannot be longer than three words. The game consists of six rounds so you will have to keep playing until the end to find out the winner. Then, the players have the option of restarting the game or ending it.
